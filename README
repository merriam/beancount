Description
===========

A double-entry accounting system that uses a simple text file format
as input. A few Python scripts are used to parse the contents of the
file, for example, to serve the contents as a locally running web
server. Scripts are provided to convert from OFX files into Ledger
input format, and other formats (easily extensible). 

Notes:

- The ideas and syntax is entirely inspired by John Wigley's Ledger_,
  and the syntax is pretty much compatible with it. Beancount's syntax
  is a subset of Ledger (a little more restrictive), with a few
  additional directives. You should probably read Ledger's
  documentation in order to you use Beancount.

- Beancount is a Python version of Ledger, and thus is much slower,
  but also much easier to extend (the code is pure Python).

- Beancount provides a simple web front to view the contents of the
  database, so you don't have to parse the entire file everytime you
  want to view a different account (this helps mitigate the fact that
  parsing is comparatively slow).

- New features can be expected to flow between Ledger and Beancount,
  as the authors have been in touch and have discussed ways of doing
  integration. In particular, Ledger is being augmented with the
  ability to export its parser with a binding for the Python language,
  so Beancount's parser may eventually use the Ledger parser for
  speed, and Ledger may eventually leverage Beancount's web front-end.

Running the Demo
================

There is a demonstration ledger input file under the examples
directory. To run a local web server on the example demo file, cd into
``examples`` and run the demo scripts.


Download
========

You can obtain the Ledger source from Furius' public Mercurial
repository, by typing the following command::

  hg clone https://hg.furius.ca/public/beancount
