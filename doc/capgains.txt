  Use #1.
  Also, you have to use the "average" purchased price for the asset. In other words, if you bought 100 AAPL at USD40/share, then bought another 100 AAPL at USD60/share, and finally sold 50 AAPL at USD70/share, you do not get to choose which lot you are selling from; instead, you have to think of having 200 AAPL at USD50/share; that's your cost basis; so when you sell the 50 AAPL at USD70/share, you are making USD20 a share (and are left with 150 AAPL at USD50/share).
  I actually prefer to think in terms of total costs. It is easier to understand, easier to program, and easier to account for commission costs.
  So, the example becomes: you bought 100 AAPL at USD4,000, then you bought another 100 AAPL at USD6,000, and finally sold 50 AAPL at USD3,500. Just before the sale, you had 200 AAPL at USD10,000; after the sale, you are left with 150 AAPL at USD6,500.
  Super-simple.
  Splits and stock exchanges are also very simple. Say, AAPL now splits 2:1, then I will have 300 AAPL at USD6,500; finally, something happens and they are exchanged for EEPL at 3:2 and I am left with 450 EEPL at USD6,500. See the cost basis never changes.
  For tax reporting in a different currency, say CAD, you simply have to replace all USD figures with CAD figures using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction where the USD currency is used (when you buy and when you sell), then you run all the transactions from scratch to update your holdings and realized gains (and you will have your report in the new currency).
  My software does all this, but it is extremely simple.

      Thanks for the clarification.

      For calculating the gain, do you

      1) convert the cost to CAD, convert the proceeds to CAD, then take the
      difference?
      (removing the commissions before converting each time)

      or

      2) calculate the capital gains in foreign currency (e.g. USD), minus the
      commission costs, and then convert at the rate when you closed your
      position?
